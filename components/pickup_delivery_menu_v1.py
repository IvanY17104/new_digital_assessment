#Bugs
#Will only work for valid input "d" and "p"

#menu so that user can choose either pickup or delivery

print ("Do you want your order delivered or are you picking it up?")
print ("For delivery enter d, for pickup enter p")#Asks user what they want to choose

delivery = input()#Makes "delivery" an input

if delivery == "d":
    print("Delivery")#If delivery input is d prints delivery

elif delivery == "p":
    print("Pickup")#If delivery input is p prints pickup
